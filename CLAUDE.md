# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is currently an empty project directory named "RAG" (likely intended for Retrieval-Augmented Generation). No source code or project structure exists yet.

## Current Configuration

- **VS Code Workspace**: `RAG.code-workspace` defines the workspace root
- **Claude Permissions**: `.claude/settings.local.json` allows `find` and `ls` bash commands

## When Code is Added

As this project develops, this file should be updated with:
- Build and development commands
- Testing commands
- Project architecture and structure
- Key dependencies and their purposes
- Development workflow specifics

Until then, Claude Code should:
1. Check for new project files before assuming structure
2. Ask users about intended project setup if creating new files
3. Update this CLAUDE.md when significant project structure is established
